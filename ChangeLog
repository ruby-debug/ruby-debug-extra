2010-04-18 14:52  Rocky Bernstein

	* Forgot to add file to test against

2010-04-18 14:49  Rocky Bernstein

	* Add test for filename with embedded space.

2010-04-18 13:49  Rocky Bernstein

	* Tolerate Ruby without readline better. Tracker #23925

2010-04-18 07:18  Rocky Bernstein

	* Fix bug in "reload" command. tracker #26130

2010-04-15 18:48  Rocky Bernstein

	* Fix bug if info not given with any parameters. rubyforge bug
	  #26895.

2010-04-15 18:45  Rocky Bernstein

	* Had forgot to add Ruby file to test brkpt-class bug.

2010-03-21 23:09  Rocky Bernstein

	* Add ability to start remote debugging on random ports and to
	  query those ports. Tracker #27889 from Hongli Lai.

2010-03-21 22:54  Rocky Bernstein

	* Allow breakpoints at class methods. Patch #26987 from Mark
	  Moseley. See also http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/193901

2010-03-12 20:27  Rocky Bernstein

	* irb.rb: Goodness backported from rbdbgr. Add IRB 'q' for quit and
	  ability to
	  run debugger commands from inside irb via dbgr, e.g. >> dbgr
	  'where'
	  
	  kill.rb: remove spurious debug output
	  
	  Rakefile: add install targets (backport from rbdbgr)

2009-11-30 19:13  Rocky Bernstein

	* Make sure we don't match more than 'down' or 'up' when not
	  followed by a space. Tracker #26554

2009-09-24 20:37  Rocky Bernstein

	* Duplicate class names was masking tests from being run. Thanks to
	  Mark Moseley for pointing out the bug.
	  
	  set basename now extends to breakpoint positions to facilitate
	  testing.

2009-04-12 00:42  Rocky Bernstein

	* Track rdebug change -- really should remove tdebug.rb. Add -d
	  ($DEBUG) option to helper

2009-04-11 16:34  Rocky Bernstein

	* Quote rdebug filenames before shelling to syntax check - tracker
	  #23862

2009-04-04 14:11  Rocky Bernstein

	* Make test-save less installation-specific

2009-04-04 08:42  Kent Sibilev

	* fixed IRB initialization in Ruby 1.8.7
	  
	  'irb' command blows up when debugger is started with
	  ./script/server --debugger

2009-03-29 03:00  Rocky Bernstein

	* Canonicalize breakpoint locations a little better. More work
	  should be done and more work should be done on the testing side
	  too.

2009-03-17 10:35  Rocky Bernstein

	* Document irb additions old and new

2009-03-17 10:33  Rocky Bernstein

	* irb "next" -> "n" since "next" is a reserved word.

2009-03-17 10:30  Rocky Bernstein

	* Fix some irb -d breakage when set autoirb is in effect

2009-03-17 10:22  Rocky Bernstein

	* Add "next" and "step" commands in irb

2009-03-17 02:05  Rocky Bernstein

	* configure.ac: in 0.10.4vc now. Add -d in irb facilitate debugger
	  testing via global $rdebug_state. Also set $rdebug_state in
	  debuggertesting is set.
	  "kill" is now allowed as a control command, this adjusts output.
	  and this changes

2009-03-11 18:57  Rocky Bernstein

	* Update "catch" command help string. Reindent some emacs files to
	  make tests happy.

2009-01-23 17:20  Rocky Bernstein

	* Add a kill command

2008-12-24 03:32  Rocky Bernstein

	* One more quit test.

2008-12-24 03:21  Rocky Bernstein

	* Allow ! suffix on {q{,uit},exit} to be the same as
	  "unconditionally" #23299

2008-11-25 02:43  Rocky Bernstein

	* Frame without a frame number means frame 0, same as gdb. We are
	  now in 0.10.4 territory now.

2008-11-17 07:34  Rocky Bernstein

	* Last commit before release.

2008-11-16 00:14  Rocky Bernstein

	* Add rdoc for rdebug script.

2008-11-14 19:37  Rocky Bernstein

	* Go over documentation for 0.10.3 release. rdoc creates files in
	  doc/rdoc.

2008-11-14 19:28  Rocky Bernstein

	* Go over documentation and revise.

2008-11-14 15:32  Rocky Bernstein

	* Move Debugger#debugger from base to cli. Revert code in
	  ruby_debug.c and block parameter in debugger. cf. -> Compare
	  with. Document Debugger.start better.

2008-11-11 15:33  Rocky Bernstein

	* Start unit test for command regular expressions. Much more
	  willing out to be done later....

2008-11-11 14:42  Rocky Bernstein

	* More line number changes in tdebug

2008-11-11 14:40  Rocky Bernstein

	* tdebug lines have changed

2008-11-11 02:07  Rocky Bernstein

	* Tweak truncated stack test since Ruby's caller doesn't seem to
	  include (tail?) recursive calls and we do. Get regression tests
	  working in light of recent changes.

2008-11-10 02:56  Kent Sibilev

	* Trying to fix "if $0 == __FILE__" ruby's idiom. Apparently
	  setting $0 to
	  a new value doesn't work correctly. (Ruby's bug?)
	  
	  $ cat t3.rb
	  p $0
	  p File.expand_path $0
	  $0 = File.expand_path $0
	  p $0
	  $ ruby t3.rb
	  "t3.rb"
	  "/Users/kent/Work/ruby-debug/trunk/t3.rb"
	  "/Users/ke"

2008-11-07 19:35  Rocky Bernstein

	* Change truncated frame message.

2008-11-07 10:39  Rocky Bernstein

	* Add check to "where" to see if the call stack is truncated; task
	  #2354

2008-10-27 15:29  Rocky Bernstein

	* tdebug.rb line numbers changed. Update test numbers -- I think
	  this is right.

2008-10-25 18:10  Rocky Bernstein

	* Fix mismatched interface.

2008-10-25 16:01  Rocky Bernstein

	* Warn and add a "confirmation" when setting a breakpoint on a file
	  that is not loaded. Regression tests no longer fail.

2008-09-22 21:01  Rocky Bernstein

	* Remove a $DEBUG warning

2008-09-22 00:07  Rocky Bernstein

	* #22118 bug in showing variables post mortem. Patch thanks to
	  rubikitch.
	  Update pm.rb integration test.

2008-09-21 23:09  Rocky Bernstein

	* In 0.10.3 territory now.

2008-09-21 23:06  Rocky Bernstein

	* tdebug.rb: modify frozen string taken from rdebug. Patch from
	  Martin Krauskopf.
	  ruby_debug.c: in 0.10.3 now.

2008-09-03 17:29  Rocky Bernstein

	* Show line numbers when $DEBUG is set. Patch #21772 from Martin
	  Krauskopf

2008-08-28 05:41  Kent Sibilev

	* preparing version 0.10.2

2008-08-15 17:36  Kent Sibilev

	* Fixed an exception when calling Kernel#debugger method from the
	  eval code

2008-07-10 09:47  Kent Sibilev

	* allow 'continue' command from post-mortem
	  
	  here is an example where it is needed:
	  
	  ...
	  Debugger.post_mortem do
	  method_that_raises_an_exception()
	  end
	  ...
	  
	  I want to be able to inspect the post_mortem context and then to
	  continue the program execution

2008-07-09 19:43  Kent Sibilev

	* allow setting a breakpoint on a file that is not yet loaded

2008-07-09 19:29  Kent Sibilev

	* RemoteInterface should extend Interface class

2008-07-09 19:25  Kent Sibilev

	* $0 is frozen in Ruby 1.8.7

2008-07-09 00:43  Rocky Bernstein

	* Some meager (and not complete) support for a verbose mode on
	  source'ing a file. Some more print's turned to errmsg as
	  appropriate.

2008-06-20 06:46  Rocky Bernstein

	* trace.rb: add "trace var"
	  ruby-debug-base.rb: remove another undefined warning.

2008-05-27 03:54  Rocky Bernstein

	* Add save test. save.rb: use pretty-printed regexp. Interface, for
	  now
	  add restart_file accessor like the others. The processor
	  interface
	  need revision though.

2008-05-23 14:57  Rocky Bernstein

	* Catchpoints have changed. Fix bug in saving them.

2008-05-23 01:04  Rocky Bernstein

	* Lots of bogosity fixed in catchpoint handling. Added "catch xxx
	  off".
	  Confirm when deleting all catchpoints. Correct C rdoc.
	  #20237

2008-05-17 22:11  Rocky Bernstein

	* Wording a little closer to gdb's ;-)

2008-05-15 18:06  Rocky Bernstein

	* Ignore config.private.yaml which folks may use/customize to omit
	  tests

2008-05-15 17:52  Rocky Bernstein

	* Regression test for recent "catch nn off" error. Again from
	  Martin Krauskopf

2008-05-15 16:05  Rocky Bernstein

	* Handle "catch nnn off" Forgotten there during r656.
	  From mkrauskopf [#20156].

2008-05-12 03:21  Rocky Bernstein

	* Small doc fix.

2008-05-11 15:25  Rocky Bernstein

	* tdebug.rb got a line shorter.

2008-05-11 09:03  Rocky Bernstein

	* Patch #19934 multi-interpreter patch from Martin Krauskopf

2008-05-11 08:38  Rocky Bernstein

	* Remove stop in debug_load due to Debugger.start getting called
	  twice.
	  The fix -- for now -- is to add another parameter to debug_load
	  to
	  indicate not to increment debug_count. We could also make that
	  the
	  default in debug_load as well, but debug_load might be useful in
	  other
	  situations and where control_threads are not relevant (which is
	  why we
	  need to call Debugger.start rather than let debug_load do it).
	  
	  Bug #19930

2008-05-05 18:05  Rocky Bernstein

	* make test-frame installation independent. Bug #19931

2008-04-29 14:00  Rocky Bernstein

	* Small doc and test improvements on 'method signature'

2008-04-29 13:37  Rocky Bernstein

	* Test line number in "continue" command for validity.

2008-04-29 09:11  Rocky Bernstein

	* Add "method signature" command to show a method's signature.

2008-04-29 08:23  Rocky Bernstein

	* Forgot to add this on last commit.

2008-04-28 16:42  Rocky Bernstein

	* Catch errors in improper set callstyle parameter. Bug #19792

2008-04-28 16:16  Rocky Bernstein

	* From Martin Krauskopf via patch #19779
	  
	  Allow folks to configure Ruby used for CLI tests in the
	  test/config.yaml. The defaults are for native Ruby, so nothing
	  needs
	  to be done for ruby-debug.
	  
	  Developers of interfaces other than cli might override
	  config.yaml by
	  customized config.private.yaml which is ignored. So there will be
	  no
	  trash in e.g. 'svn st' output when developer customize the Ruby
	  to be
	  used.
	  
	  Handy for alternative interface implementations using
	  svn:externals.

2008-04-25 02:54  Rocky Bernstein

	* Try to get rdebug-track under control again.
	  Remove "<" in the command buffer as a local key setting.
	  Make more checkdoc friendly.

2008-04-19 13:22  Rocky Bernstein

	* Change test for whether we have moved off a line or not for
	  purposes
	  of stopping at a breakpoint on a line. The line events for which
	  there
	  are normally two stops are on NODE if's before the if and after
	  the
	  expression evaluation. Tracker #19594.

2008-04-16 01:11  Rocky Bernstein

	* In 0.10.2 now. Some work to cope systems without readline. More
	  work is needed.
	  Add test of "set autoeval." Undefined command message more
	  closely like gdb's.

2008-04-10 08:49  Rocky Bernstein

	* linecache is required by ruby-debug-base not ruby-debug. Thanks
	  Martin!

2008-04-08 14:16  Rocky Bernstein

	* Another test data line number change

2008-04-08 14:12  Rocky Bernstein

	* tdebug.rb alignment with rdebug

2008-04-08 14:02  Rocky Bernstein

	* Forgot to add this for the linetrace+ test.

2008-04-08 10:23  Rocky Bernstein

	* Another linetrace test. This time with linetrace+ set.

2008-04-08 10:19  Rocky Bernstein

	* processor.rb: Silence possibly more warnings under $DEBUG
	  test/*: another linetrace test using the linetrace command.

2008-04-08 03:17  Rocky Bernstein

	* Test line numbers changed. Sigh

2008-04-08 03:14  Rocky Bernstein

	* Track rdebug.

2008-04-08 03:10  Rocky Bernstein

	* Oops forget this test

2008-04-08 03:09  Rocky Bernstein

	* Fix bug in --trace. Add regression test for that as well.
	  Reduce (but alas not eliminate) extraneous line tracing.

2008-04-07 00:36  Rocky Bernstein

	* ruby-debug-base.rb: document Debugger.start parameters.
	  CHANGES: Revise what's happened
	  test-shortkey.el: A failing regression test because I think
	  rdebug-shortkey-mode
	  is not correct.

2008-04-06 03:03  Rocky Bernstein

	* Assigning $0 on cygwin seems weird. cygwin readline different too

2008-04-06 02:13  Rocky Bernstein

	* read_command on OSX seems to work differently. Punt for now.

2008-04-04 19:22  Rocky Bernstein

	* Sometimes remove_method isn't defined.

2008-04-03 19:01  Rocky Bernstein

	* Allow setting :post_mortem => true from Debugger.start.

2008-04-03 14:15  Rocky Bernstein

	* test-pm.rb, post-mortem-osx.right: Allow for tmate command on
	  OSX.
	  annotate.*: make sure 'set force on' doesn't happen.

2008-04-03 12:06  Rocky Bernstein

	* irb is no longer 'experimental'.

2008-03-23 17:47  Rocky Bernstein

	* set.rb -> settings.rb since it's already one command per file,
	  and
	  remove another :nodoc.
	  Rakefile: split long line

2008-03-23 04:12  Rocky Bernstein

	* rdebug-core.el: allow rdebug-reset as an emasc command
	  show.rb: remove one more :nodoc

2008-03-19 15:07  Rocky Bernstein

	* Fix bug in "list -": was scrolling back to negative lines. Had
	  also been skipping lines in forward list.

2008-03-19 07:36  Rocky Bernstein

	* remove 'nodoc' (and doc) from InfoCommand class

2008-03-18 19:47  Rocky Bernstein

	* Try to make more readible.

2008-03-18 16:05  Rocky Bernstein

	* Fix bug in 'list' command when wrapping off the end.
	  test-finish.rb: tolerate buggy in Ruby versions <= 1.8.7.

2008-03-18 00:43  Rocky Bernstein

	* Split off reload into its own file.

2008-03-17 04:03  Rocky Bernstein

	* stepping.rb: don't step if invalid parameter
	  command.rb: remove dupliate defined warning msg

2008-03-17 03:34  Rocky Bernstein

	* Small doc addition

2008-03-17 03:17  Rocky Bernstein

	* Make source file-not-found and error

2008-03-17 03:07  Rocky Bernstein

	* tidy regexp

2008-03-17 03:05  Rocky Bernstein

	* Rename to match command name. Add miniscule doc.

2008-03-16 22:04  Rocky Bernstein

	* Doc changes

2008-03-16 16:38  Rocky Bernstein

	* Add debug_load test. Document Debugger::Context better. Small doc
	  changes.

2008-03-16 15:01  Rocky Bernstein

	* Typo.

2008-03-16 07:39  Rocky Bernstein

	* Minor doc changes

2008-03-16 06:50  Rocky Bernstein

	* Make sure width is set explicitly so we don't have vagaries of
	  the environment.

2008-03-16 06:44  Rocky Bernstein

	* Possibly patch change to upcoming 1.8.7. Punt for now.

2008-03-16 04:03  Rocky Bernstein

	* Change finish with no args to finish out of the currently
	  selected
	  frame and document that.
	  Add test for "finish" command.
	  ruby-debug.texi: Note 2nd-hook eval bug in "if" statements.
	  
	  ruby-debug.texi:

2008-03-13 02:15  Rocky Bernstein

	* INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: "finish" works like gdb - stop just before
	  the
	  most recent method finishes. Will now accept a number which stops
	  that
	  many frames completed. (Note that return line numbers will be
	  funny,
	  the first line of the method until Ruby 1.8.7.)

2008-03-11 03:53  Rocky Bernstein

	* Reduce unnecessary dependencies and scope.

2008-03-10 14:51  Rocky Bernstein

	* "catch" is same as "info catch". Document better "catch" command.

2008-03-10 13:28  Rocky Bernstein

	* Dunno why we are now one line number less. So be it (for now).

2008-03-10 11:42  Rocky Bernstein

	* Break out finish.rb and continue.rb from stepping.rb

2008-03-09 23:30  Rocky Bernstein

	* For now we require the duplicate numbers on conditionals.

2008-03-07 04:26  Rocky Bernstein

	* Use ~/.rdboptrc (rdbopt.ini on MS Windows) to change default
	  options.

2008-03-03 04:14  Rocky Bernstein

	* Split off quit to it's own file since it doesn't share code with
	  the
	  reset of "control". Smaller is better and it helps deal with
	  meeting
	  in the middle for extending debug 1.9 code.

2008-03-03 01:50  Rocky Bernstein

	* Allow spaces at the end of step and next. Test ";" between
	  commands.

2008-03-02 16:45  Rocky Bernstein

	* Add ability to specify a thread number in a "frame" command.

2008-03-02 04:20  Rocky Bernstein

	* Better error message for an invalid break command.

2008-03-02 02:48  Rocky Bernstein

	* Small changes. Use unshift instead of << and Remove from $: after
	  done.
	  base.rb: Debugger.start -> Debugger.start_

2008-02-28 05:06  Rocky Bernstein

	* breakpoints.{cmd,right}: test for an invalid stopping line number
	  rdebug-fns.el: move generic split-string-and-unquote from
	  rdebug-core.
	  rdebug-core.el: Add rdebug-common-init to replace
	  gud-common-init. Is
	  simpler, and finds files better via debugger output/annotations.
	  Fix bug in rdebug-setup-windows: gud-find-file can return nil,
	  and
	  we still need to set buf.

2008-02-26 00:57  Rocky Bernstein

	* Fix bug in "info file xxx breakpoints".

2008-02-25 12:39  Rocky Bernstein

	* File.exists? -> File.exist? for Ruby 1.9

2008-02-24 16:36  Rocky Bernstein

	* rdebug; make more Ruby 1.9 compatible.

2008-02-24 16:14  Rocky Bernstein

	* Minor changes.
	  rdbg.rb: don't need $DEBUG test any more
	  rdebug-regexp.el: go over with checkdoc
	  bin/rdebug: use PATH_SEPARATOR (for 'doze again)

2008-02-24 04:51  Rocky Bernstein

	* CLI: Add long help for "info file".
	  
	  test/test-help.rb: Make test failures easier to fix and more like
	  the
	  other tests.
	  
	  emacs/test: finish testing all of the funcitons in rdebug-fns.el
	  
	  rdebug-layouts.el: Make checkdoc clean.
	  rdebug-track.el: don't need to rename shell buffer. Do it as an
	  option only.
	  rdebug-secondary.el: get rid of hoaky buffer finding for at least
	  gud-comint-buf. (Should probably do others as well)
	  
	  DOC: Note weird line stopping locations. Describe what "ctrl" in
	  prompt means.

2008-02-22 09:31  Rocky Bernstein

	* Need to handle glob expansion in program script on restart.
	  File.exists? -> File.exist?

2008-02-19 23:44  Rocky Bernstein

	* rdebug-cmd.el: M-insert toggles shortkey mode in the command
	  buffer
	  rdebug: search for Ruby program if file is not found and no
	  SEPARATOR
	  chars in the filename

2008-02-19 15:20  Rocky Bernstein

	* Add "show post-mortem". Note "show port" now requires 3 letters:
	  "show por"
	  to distinguish it from "show post-mortem".

2008-02-19 13:56  Rocky Bernstein

	* remove annotate=2. Emacs code can now redirect output to command
	  or to buffer.
	  rdebug-track.el

2008-02-17 13:57  Rocky Bernstein

	* Add Debugger.last_exception. Show exception in post-mortem when
	  "info program"
	  is issued. Reorganize list of major changes better.

2008-02-13 21:47  Rocky Bernstein

	* processor.rb: spelled "post-mortem" incorrectly in prompt.

2008-02-12 02:06  Rocky Bernstein

	* Fix bug in "info thread verbose" which wasn't showing full
	  traceback.

2008-02-11 02:29  Rocky Bernstein

	* Add "info thread". Pound on "info threads" to make it more like
	  pydb. In particular we can give stack traces for the threads.
	  Towards
	  addressing issue #12663.

2008-02-09 15:48  Rocky Bernstein

	* helper.rb Failed attempt to DRY tests more. But save what we have
	  which may someday in the future be used to go further. Minus to
	  undercore in Data file names in preparation such time. (We'll use
	  the
	  filename as the test name).
	  
	  testing

2008-02-09 11:55  Rocky Bernstein

	* Fix bug where we entered debugger code if we "next" over code
	  that
	  goes raises an uncaught exception. Needed to reset stepping
	  parameters. Added a routine to do so.

2008-02-05 16:30  Rocky Bernstein

	* Remove "* used as prefix argument" warning.

2008-02-05 01:41  Rocky Bernstein

	* rdebug.el: Add a defgroup for rdebug so customization in Emacs 23
	  is possible.
	  Some other minor doc fixes.
	  setshow.* make sure we don't have an $Id line that we have to
	  check against.

2008-02-03 15:23  Rocky Bernstein

	* Try to get testing a little more organized, although more work
	  should
	  be done: Create a data directory for comparison ("right") and
	  script
	  command ("cmd") files. Code is now more uniform (and should DRY'd
	  a
	  bit more).

2008-02-03 04:17  Rocky Bernstein

	* Add some argument checking in setting catchpoints.
	  Showing status on "info catch" is a little silly - we can't
	  recover from
	  an exception.

2008-02-02 23:10  Rocky Bernstein

	* Remove commands in post-mortem which are not applicable,
	  e.g."step",
	  "next", "continue"...
	  
	  "No breakpoints have been set" is now an error message when
	  trying to
	  set a breakpoint.
	  
	  Add post-mortem test.
	  
	  Debug.init no longer exists.

2008-02-02 09:27  Rocky Bernstein

	* Remove Debugger.init and fold options parameter into
	  Debugger.start.
	  Old Debugger.start has been renamed Deebugger.start_

2008-02-01 03:09  Rocky Bernstein

	* Allow multiple exceptions to be caught.
	  
	  INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: varible Debugger.catchpoint a String was
	  turned
	  into Debugger.catchpoints, a Hash. Debugger.catchpoint= no longer
	  exists. Debugger.set_catchpoint was turned into
	  Debugger.add_catchpoint
	  
	  "info catch" added.
	  
	  INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: variable Debugger.catchpoint is now
	  Debugger.catchpoints
	  which is a now hash rather than a String. Debugger.catchpoint= no
	  longer exists.
	  
	  A catchpoint ruby-debug-base test added. use unshift in requires.
	  
	  rdebug: --post-mortem now really catches uncaught exceptions and
	  brings you to post-mortem handling.

2008-01-31 16:24  Rocky Bernstein

	* ruby_debug.c: more adventures in exception handling
	  processor.rb: Removal of crash when annotate is on. Need to fix
	  the source of the
	  problem though.

2008-01-31 15:16  Rocky Bernstein

	* Handle post-mortem and exception traceback reporting in
	  ruby-debug

2008-01-31 03:01  Rocky Bernstein

	* Have Debug.load recover from uncaught error raised in a debugged
	  program.
	  Go over regression tests.

2008-01-30 21:33  Anders Lindgren

	* Test case ensuring that an error in the user code doesn't cause
	  the debugger to single step it's own code. (This is currently
	  broken.)

2008-01-30 17:13  Rocky Bernstein

	* Add broken "info file" information.

2008-01-30 17:01  Rocky Bernstein

	* Add Command.find() to find a subcommand name.
	  condition.right: correct for breakpoint hit counts.

2008-01-30 01:43  Rocky Bernstein

	* Add number of times a breakpoint is hit like gdb does.

2008-01-29 22:37  Rocky Bernstein

	* Columnize breakpoint output.

2008-01-29 22:19  Rocky Bernstein

	* test-ctrl.rb: try to make it influenced less by environment.
	  rdebug-frames.el remove unused local variable.

2008-01-29 21:13  Anders Lindgren

	* * Fixed a problem where the source buffer opened in the wrong
	  window.
	  Turned out that the Stack Frame buffer setup function tried to
	  display the current frame itself, instead of letting the normal
	  source annotations handle this.
	  
	  * Fixed a problem with an annotation turning up in the debugger
	  shell
	  buffer. The 'frame' command emitted a source annotation without
	  the
	  "source" part.
	  
	  * In the stack frame window, when selecting a frame to display,
	  the
	  point is now placed at the beginning of the line of the active
	  frame.
	  
	  * Internal restructuring of the pick source window parts.

2008-01-29 11:20  Rocky Bernstein

	* More annotate=2 fixes.

2008-01-28 21:11  Rocky Bernstein

	* Disable for now.

2008-01-28 16:18  Rocky Bernstein

	* Some more work on test-hist. Not working yet completely though.

2008-01-28 15:59  Rocky Bernstein

	* Add info file breakpoints to show lines which we can set a
	  breakpoint on.
	  Revise so we chdir into SRC_DIR.
	  test-hist.rb is broken - will fix later.

2008-01-28 15:50  Rocky Bernstein

	* Comparison file for test-hist.rb

2008-01-28 03:15  Rocky Bernstein

	* Make show commands a little more like gdb. Document it too.

2008-01-28 02:24  Rocky Bernstein

	* interface.rb: Command history not saved between local rdebug
	  sessions. Patch from Martin Krauskopf #17491.
	  show.rb: add "show commands" so we can see the command history.
	  test/* Add a history regression test.

2008-01-26 01:45  Rocky Bernstein

	* Add test of new Debugger.init

2008-01-25 12:11  Rocky Bernstein

	* Add Debugger.init which intializes things that rdebug does. This
	  allows a restart even though rdebug wasn't called initially.

2008-01-23 02:53  Rocky Bernstein

	* Add subcommand/long help for enable, disable, set, and show. Put
	  Subcommand structure in Command. More work is needed to reduce
	  redundancy.

2008-01-22 23:15  Rocky Bernstein

	* Allow "help info xxx". Add ability for long help on "info"
	  command.
	  Add "info break xx".
	  
	  test: remove test/unit class name conflicts. All the tests we
	  wrote
	  now get run.

2008-01-20 22:01  Rocky Bernstein

	* We now only allow breakpoints on stopping lines. We get this via
	  linecache which ultimately gets it from ParseTree.

2008-01-19 19:28  Rocky Bernstein

	* Move ruby-debug-base tests to base directory. Add a binding_n
	  regression test.

2008-01-17 22:29  Rocky Bernstein

	* lines -> size.

2008-01-17 20:28  Rocky Bernstein

	* Add "info file" in addition to "info files" Use some features in
	  linecache 0.3
	  which are in SVN only. Give SHA1, number of lines and timestamp
	  on a specific
	  file.

2008-01-17 06:58  Rocky Bernstein

	* info file -> info files

2008-01-17 03:33  Rocky Bernstein

	* "info file" -> "info files" as per gdb.

2008-01-16 18:42  Rocky Bernstein

	* Need to present source filename (__FILE__) as Ruby and therefore
	  breakpoint
	  sees it.
	  

2008-01-16 02:19  Rocky Bernstein

	* Line caching moved to an external gem, linecache. We now require
	  version 0.2 of that or greater.

2008-01-14 01:31  Rocky Bernstein

	* Make rdebug-track work better in the face of prompt and error
	  annotations.
	  control.rb: need another test when rdebug not called initially.

2008-01-13 21:51  Rocky Bernstein

	* Some stack -> frame renaming
	  ext/breakpoint.c: put methods in alpha order (to help with
	  reference man)
	  breakpoints.rb: one print -> errmsg

2008-01-13 20:32  Rocky Bernstein

	* Seems we don't get a core dump any more.

2008-01-13 18:13  Rocky Bernstein

	* Create errmsg routine for error output, start tagging error
	  messages
	  as errors. Under annotate 3, output errors similar to gdb
	  --annotate
	  does (although still simplified). Have Emacs pick up debugger
	  error
	  annotations.

2008-01-13 04:05  Rocky Bernstein

	* Check validity of expressions in breakpoint conditions and don't
	  allow
	  enabling a syntactically invalid expression.
	  
	  Start noting messages which are errors via an errmsg routine.

2008-01-12 13:35  Rocky Bernstein

	* Typo.

2008-01-11 10:26  Rocky Bernstein

	* Document that ruby-debug resets $0. Align program options in ref
	  manual and --help. Alphabetize better.

2008-01-11 10:10  Rocky Bernstein

	* rdebug: do syntax checking when running as server as well as
	  local interface. --no-quit intercepts Syntax Errors now
	  (which shouldn't happen and means there's another bug in there to
	  fix; but robustness is good.)
	  Bring tdebug.rb more in line iwth rdebug until we can get rid of
	  it altogether. Note some of the current weaknesses.

2008-01-10 22:56  Rocky Bernstein

	* More correct $0 fix. Deal with the case ./ is automatically
	  added.
	  However this might not be right in all cases.

2008-01-10 21:57  Rocky Bernstein

	* Fix for "if $0 == __FILE__" idiom. Bug #16038
	  rdebug-core.el add '--'; -emacs -> --emacs
	  rdebug: add subroutines for calling debugger and processing
	  options.

2008-01-10 10:34  Rocky Bernstein

	* Add condition command.

2008-01-08 02:36  Rocky Bernstein

	* Rewrite runner.sh in Ruby: rdbg.rb
	  Were it not for a bug that needs to be fixed, we could
	  remove runner.sh. test-output.rb hits this bug.

2008-01-07 23:02  Rocky Bernstein

	* Note need for VC6.

2008-01-07 20:51  Rocky Bernstein

	* What's changed.

2008-01-07 20:38  Rocky Bernstein

	* Add "var class". This means "var const .." can no longer be
	  abbreviated "var c"; use "var co" instead.
	  (Or "var const" or "var constant"

2008-01-07 19:57  Rocky Bernstein

	* Add class level variables to "info variables"

2008-01-07 17:37  Rocky Bernstein

	* Add "self" to list "info variables" spits out.

2008-01-07 09:59  Rocky Bernstein

	* --emacs sets width to 120. rdebug-core.el will reset to 120
	  unless it's already that.

2008-01-07 09:08  Rocky Bernstein

	* Add Anders' instruction on how to compile in MS Windows (modified
	  slightly).

2008-01-06 21:16  Rocky Bernstein

	* Syntax error.

2008-01-06 20:56  Rocky Bernstein

	* test/*-emacs-basic*, tdebug: Add test of running in Emacs without
	  annotations.
	  
	  emacs/*.el: make regexp tests work again, move regexp to from
	  core to regexp.
	  Add an annotate regexp test.
	  
	  processor.rb: Remove some anotation print from bleeding into
	  output
	  when annotations are not wanted. Reinstate "Program finished" in
	  annotations and outside (rdebug).

2008-01-06 18:55  Rocky Bernstein

	* Create Processor class and subclass that. Perhaps a mixin would
	  be good.
	  Remove annotation output bleanding when annotate is off.
	  Try to reduce the mess annotations is adding to processor.rb
	  rdebug-core.el: fix indentation to pass the regression test
	  Anders added
	  Makefile.am: Add rdebug-source.el to distribution.
	  Make sure "rake test"

2008-01-06 12:31  Anders Lindgren

	* Emacs interface adopted to new annotations scheme.

2008-01-06 06:46  Rocky Bernstein

	* correct output for source test

2008-01-06 06:44  Rocky Bernstein

	* The source command now allows us to read in breakpoint in the
	  current
	  context. More work is needed but this is a start.

2008-01-06 02:15  Rocky Bernstein

	* Some work on saving state across a restart. More work is needed
	  on the
	  script command to get this working. The save-file name is now
	  optional. save.rb split off from script.rb Display expressions
	  and
	  some settings are now captured in the save/restore file.
	  Add interface.finalize - things that need to be done before quit
	  or
	  restart.

2008-01-05 21:16  Rocky Bernstein

	* More work to make annotate more like gdb's.
	  starting/stopping/exiting
	  should be more similar. Some code has been commented out until we
	  get
	  the Emacs interface to match. See "FIXME: ANNOTATE" in
	  processor.rb.
	  Also regression tests for output and annotate currently fail for
	  this
	  reason.

2008-01-05 13:46  Rocky Bernstein

	* Add edit command.
	  breakpoints.rb/helper.rb: bad regular-expression separation.

2008-01-05 13:24  Anders Lindgren

	* Added test case for the 'starting' annotation. (It currently
	  fails since the annotation is broken.)

2008-01-05 10:36  Rocky Bernstein

	* Catch places were we can't set breakpoints or delete breakpoints
	  because
	  we don't have context set.

2008-01-04 07:43  Rocky Bernstein

	* @history_save can sometimes be undefined. Test for it so we don't
	  get a warning
	  when $DEBUG/$WARING is true.

2008-01-02 20:35  Rocky Bernstein

	* helper.rb: add regexp for a position. TODO: add parsing routine
	  and use in
	  various commands

2008-01-02 17:31  Rocky Bernstein

	* A little more robust.

2008-01-02 14:41  Rocky Bernstein

	* processor.rb: Redo where starting/exiting annotations are done.
	  rdebug.el: back off on setting output command for now.

2008-01-02 04:17  Rocky Bernstein

	* --no-quit bug fixed. But we don't know how to test it properly
	  yet.

2008-01-02 04:04  Rocky Bernstein

	* Redo how --no-quit is handled. We now go into a control state
	  with
	  limited commands.
	  
	  Add annotation for "exiting"
	  
	  Add regression test for ctrl debugger state. "info" commands are
	  allowed this state although most don't do anything. Some tests
	  comments corrected.

2008-01-01 15:23  Rocky Bernstein

	* Fix --emacs to do --no-quit properly.

2007-12-31 06:08  Rocky Bernstein

	* Changes and more changes.

2007-12-31 05:55  Rocky Bernstein

	* rdebug, emacs/* doc/*: --emacs is now --emacs-basic while --emacs
	  now implies
	  --emacs-basic --annotate=3 --post-mortem --no-control --no-start
	  --no-quit
	  runall: test-*.rb are tests
	  rdebug-test-cmd.el: use 'require and add tests of
	  rdebug-{step,next}.
	  emacs/Makefile.am: break out individual test as separate targets.

2007-12-29 13:31  Rocky Bernstein

	* Remove looping on quit. "-n" is broken so remove it for now.

2007-12-29 10:50  Anders Lindgren

	* * The 'theend.rb' script is now always loaded with the 'stop'
	  flag.
	  
	  * The 'theend.rb' script is now loaded after the restarted print
	  statement.
	  
	  * Removed an 'if' statement preventing restart when the no-stop
	  flag
	  was used.
	  
	  * Added end-of-line comment in 'theend.rb' on the same line as
	  the
	  single statement. This helps people that use the command-line
	  debugger.

2007-12-29 09:29  Anders Lindgren

	* When the end of the program is reached and the --no-quit option
	  is
	  used, the user now steps into the file 'theend.rb'. This file
	  contains
	  a message telling the user that the end of the application has
	  been
	  reached. For a normal debug session this feels better. However,
	  if the
	  user file is empty, this prevents the debugger from going into an
	  infinite loop.
	  
	  Note, an alternative implementation would be if the debugger
	  itself
	  would create an artificial step point at the of the the user
	  program.

2007-12-28 15:33  Rocky Bernstein

	* info.rb: Incorrect test for no display expressions.
	  display.rb: Grammar thing.
	  processor.rb: Slightly cleaner code
	  test/* more/better tests.

2007-12-28 15:04  Rocky Bernstein

	* Forgot to check in these files when adding new tests

2007-12-28 13:48  Rocky Bernstein

	* Reduce unneccessary display annotation output.

2007-12-28 10:54  Rocky Bernstein

	* *** empty log message ***

2007-12-28 10:54  Rocky Bernstein

	* Doc bug.

2007-12-28 10:53  Rocky Bernstein

	* My old cut-and-paste error. Gotta get in my "method redefined"
	  patch into rake's test/unit.

2007-12-28 10:47  Rocky Bernstein

	* Reduce unnecesary breakpoint, stack, and variable post-command
	  annotations.
	  Fix bug in not showing empty breakpoints when last one is
	  deleted.

2007-12-27 03:11  Rocky Bernstein

	* Use columnize gem from rubyforge.
	  Remove toggle since Anders can't use - easy come, easy go.
	  rdebug-test-frame.el was broken.

2007-12-26 21:20  Rocky Bernstein

	* Note we (may) need "sudo" before installing. Also note the test
	  options.

2007-12-26 20:29  Rocky Bernstein

	* *** empty log message ***

2007-12-26 10:41  Rocky Bernstein

	* Need to escape escape (% -> %%) in "info variables"

2007-12-25 23:40  Rocky Bernstein

	* Add step- and step+. Document as well as the new toggle command.

2007-12-25 23:39  Rocky Bernstein

	* Add toggle requested by Anders Lindgren.

2007-12-25 09:55  Rocky Bernstein

	* Small doc fixes.

2007-12-25 02:51  Rocky Bernstein

	* breakpoints.*: main -> Object. Add bad Class name test
	  AUTHOR: Add Anders
	  README: note ruby-debug-extra. More precise (I think)

2007-12-24 21:02  Rocky Bernstein

	* Fix bug in stopping on a method name. Use this in the examples.

2007-12-23 17:33  Rocky Bernstein

	* Go over packaging:
	  ChangeLogs for ruby-debug-base (in ext and lib) separate from CLI
	  ChangeLog
	  ChangeLogs now map userid to names
	  ruby-debug-base regression test included in ruby-debug-base
	  Columnize test separated. (It will disappear when ruby-debug
	  requires it
	  as an external)

2007-12-22 17:07  Rocky Bernstein

	* More typos.

2007-12-22 11:18  Rocky Bernstein

	* Correct lots of little typographical and spelling errors.

2007-12-22 04:02  Rocky Bernstein

	* Sort options in alphabetical order.
	  rdebug-core.el: docstring elaboration
	  Revise Emacs section gain.

2007-12-21 23:01  Rocky Bernstein

	* Synchronize command options.

2007-12-21 20:06  Rocky Bernstein

	* rdebug, tdebug: Prevent tracing in the debugger if --no-quit is
	  in effect.
	  rdebug, tdebug: --noquit => --no-quit, --nostop -> --no-stop
	  test/*quit* Add quit test.
	  ruby-debug.texi: Doc above changes, update --help lists (e.g.
	  0.9.4 => 0.10.0)

2007-12-18 08:39  Rocky Bernstein

	* rdebug-core.el: Remember position in breakpoint window
	  rest: Fix bugs in enable/disable commands and DRY code a little
	  bit. Better regression tests
	  (needed obviously)

2007-12-17 05:40  Rocky Bernstein

	* Fix another "INTERNAL ERROR" bug in using inspect for local
	  variables.
	  Add a more thorough regression test here.
	  
	  Simplify regression tests by adding a filter Proc to the
	  run_debugger helper.

2007-12-16 21:47  Rocky Bernstein

	* Another place where we need to guard against a faulty "inspect"
	  routine.

2007-12-16 21:31  Rocky Bernstein

	* Add "info variables test".
	  
	  ruby-debug-base.rb: Not sure how test(?M, file) ever worked
	  before but change
	  to use File.stat(file).mtime
	  info.rb: ignore debugger variables which are sometimes set.

2007-12-16 17:01  Rocky Bernstein

	* Guard against buggy "inspect" and "to_str" methods in "info
	  variables".

2007-12-16 12:02  Rocky Bernstein

	* Fix syntax error with last commit.

2007-12-16 12:01  Rocky Bernstein

	* Make init file handling match gdb better and the comment in
	  run_init_script.

2007-12-16 11:50  Rocky Bernstein

	* ruby-debug.rb: The plague of MS Windows: HOMEDRIVE prepended to
	  HOMEPATH. rdebug.ini used here instead of .rdebugrc.
	  
	  info documentation and help strings revised
	  
	  Makefile.am: "test" is the same as "check" (Even though Emacs
	  testing is
	  still broken)

2007-12-16 01:12  Rocky Bernstein

	* test/*: Be more precise about file paths rather than assume Unix
	  conventions.
	  More regular about use of SRC_DIR. Had broken tests previously in
	  not
	  reinitializing SRC_DIR.
	  bin/rdebug: notstop misspelling.
	  command.rb: Don't assume that Emacs implies are using
	  annotations, or a specific
	  line width
	  rdebug-core.el: add variable to specify what you want the
	  debugger line width
	  to be

2007-12-15 17:46  Anders Lindgren

	* In Emacs mode, emit longer lines. The Variables and Watch windows
	  no longer wraps around, so long lines look good.

2007-12-14 09:03  Anders Lindgren

	* Type 'stript' => 'script'

2007-12-14 07:34  Anders Lindgren

	* Fixed problem where debugger messages ended up in the 'output'
	  buffer.

2007-12-14 03:22  Rocky Bernstein

	* ruby-debug.c, configure.ac, ruby-debug.texi: Up version to 0.9.9
	  rdebug.1: document --no-quit
	  ruby-debu.texi: More work on Emacs section.

2007-12-13 13:53  Rocky Bernstein

	* rdebug.el: Add --post-mortem option by default
	  rdebug: Fix bug introduced in adding exception handling
	  (--no-quit)

2007-12-13 13:30  Rocky Bernstein

	* ruby-debug.texi: Document --no-quit
	  processor.rb: Annotations aren't an Emacs thing
	  rdebug: handle exceptions even if --post-mortem not given (but
	  --no-quit is)

2007-12-13 02:20  Rocky Bernstein

	* doc/ruby-debug.texi: *rdebug-display-program* ->
	  rdebug-watch-program*
	  note that you can run help info and list info subcommands
	  control.rb: If unconditionally is given, no questions are asked
	  info.rb: add "info program" to give program execution status
	  rdebug: add --noquit which doesn't exit when the program
	  terminates

2007-12-12 17:20  Rocky Bernstein

	* Remove warning that appears when $VERBOSE is set because we are
	  redefining (potentially) a method.

2007-12-07 21:30  Rocky Bernstein

	* Don't always show "starting" annotation.

2007-12-07 11:03  Rocky Bernstein

	* processor.rb: Code for "starting"/output annotation
	  rdebug.el: add my own style window

2007-12-05 00:50  Rocky Bernstein

	* Fix a couple of display/undisplay bugs caught by regression
	  testing.

2007-12-05 00:06  Rocky Bernstein

	* From Anders Lindgren:
	  * Emacs primitive `window-configuration' used instead of
	  `frame-configuration' since the latter caused (among other
	  things) the
	  frame title to freeze. (The workaround for the buffer-list crash
	  is no
	  longer needed.)
	  
	  * The user can now switch between the secondary windows using
	  commands
	  bound to the capital letters B, C, D, R, V. The key ? displays a
	  help
	  buffer.
	  
	  * Commands to add, delete, and edit display (watch) expressions.
	  
	  Breakpoint regexp position change which broke goto-breakpoint.
	  display.rb, processor.rb: use nil for deleted displays, more
	  display
	  annotation

2007-12-04 11:31  Rocky Bernstein

	* enable/disable default to "breakpoint" when no subcommand
	  specified.
	  More rigorous test of the code.
	  
	  display.rb: Fix bug when Debugger.annotation not initially set.
	  
	  ruby-debug.texi: Document enable/disable and remove watchpoint
	  references. Other small changes.

2007-12-04 02:51  Rocky Bernstein

	* display.rb Don't show display if annotate > 1 since this goes in
	  the annotation buffer.
	  rdebug.el: remove minor-most-alist indicator.

2007-12-02 21:56  Rocky Bernstein

	* Show display values in display annotation.

2007-12-02 21:47  Rocky Bernstein

	* Allow enabling/disabling breakpoints. Add unit test of
	  enabling/disabling and
	  emacs regexp checking. Adjust rdebug.el accordingly.

2007-12-02 11:45  Rocky Bernstein

	* Add enable/disable commands
	  info: Show disabled display expressions (like gdb)
	  display: update help text
	  variables: remove _self from list of local variables.

2007-11-30 09:21  Rocky Bernstein

	* longer display test

2007-11-30 09:08  Rocky Bernstein

	* Correct "info display" command and make it look more like gdb.
	  Show annotations on preloop even if they are empty.
	  Create a regression test for "display" commands.

2007-11-30 04:03  Rocky Bernstein

	* Add "info display". Allow annotation level 3. (Both as gdb does)
	  Reduce unnecessary breakpoint (and stack size) stack size output.

2007-11-29 02:55  Rocky Bernstein

	* The old "info variables" is now called "info global_variables"
	  "info variables" shows local and instance_variables
	  rdebug.el: "local"" buffer is now "variable" buffer
	  Annotation buffer now show "info variables" rather than "info
	  locals"

2007-11-24 03:00  Rocky Bernstein

	* ruby_debug.c: context.frame things now allow the frame postion
	  number to be optional. We'll assume 0 (the top) as the default.
	  
	  test-ruby-debug.rb: add tests of the above an of these routines
	  in general. Make this
	  be able to run outside of rake.
	  
	  Rakefile: Removed emacs/elisp since that's now part of a
	  different package.
	  
	  doc/Makefile.am: Make manual page
	  
	  doc/ruby-debug.texi: try to clarify blocks/frames. Redo incorrect
	  frame passages as a result of vestiges of the bashdb manual.

2007-11-22 13:22  Rocky Bernstein

	* test-frame.rb: remove debugging
	  rest - use autotools to configure a ruby-debug-extra package
	  which includes
	  documentation and GNU Emacs support.

2007-11-21 00:16  Rocky Bernstein

	* Make sure @histfile is initialized before writing it. It could be
	  uninitialized if entered via Debugger.start; debugger

2007-11-16 13:50  Rocky Bernstein

	* And make sure to use "inspect" when showing instance variables as
	  well.

2007-11-16 13:48  Rocky Bernstein

	* Sort instance variables.

2007-11-15 15:59  Rocky Bernstein

	* variables.rb: Add "self" to local variables (unless it's "main")
	  #12782
	  http://rubyforge.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=12782&group_id=1900&atid=7436
	  
	  info.rb: "info args" and "info locals" output should use inspect
	  (for arrays and such)
	  helper.rb: Show output lines if "$DEBUG" (ruby -d) is set.
	  require "fileutils" since we use it.
	  setshow.*: simplify test code using common helper.rb routine
	  
	  rdebug.el: Add key binding in comint buffer for the more common
	  kind of traceback

2007-11-14 01:39  Rocky Bernstein

	* Add 'set history save' and 'set history size'.

2007-11-13 13:28  Rocky Bernstein

	* Make sure to convert string HISTSIZE to a number - This time for
	  sure!

2007-11-13 13:16  Rocky Bernstein

	* Broke regression test (actually, it was slightly broken even
	  before.)

2007-11-13 13:12  Rocky Bernstein

	* Follow gdb's history length setting just a little bit closer.

2007-11-12 14:51  Rocky Bernstein

	* Use on/off to display history saving.

2007-11-12 04:08  Rocky Bernstein

	* Forgot to update output check.

2007-11-12 01:27  Rocky Bernstein

	* Add gdb-like "show history". We don't allow set yet though.

2007-11-09 18:27  Rocky Bernstein

	* Add "method iv" (instance_variables)

2007-11-07 11:52  Rocky Bernstein

	* Rakefile: add emacs compile task. Combine common package files
	  into a variableg
	  to improve DRYness.
	  interface.rb: Apply Roger Pack's patch #12788 (add "." to
	  .rdebugsavehist if
	  other HOME and HOMEPATH aren't defined).
	  rdebug-track.el is now folded into rdebug.el so it's no longer
	  needed.
	  rdebug.el: remove compiler-detected bug

2007-11-05 15:18  Rocky Bernstein

	* rdebug.el: not all Emacs have split-string-and-unquote.
	  processor.rb, test-help.rb: Fix breakage from yesterday. Revert a
	  change

2007-11-04 15:05  Rocky Bernstein

	* Expand/revise Emacs rdebug docstring
	  test-help.rb: skip until we fix properly.

2007-11-04 14:16  Rocky Bernstein

	* Move prompt display after preloop.
	  Make rdebugtrack work with annotations.

2007-11-04 04:04  Rocky Bernstein

	* Debugger "annotation" mode. This is used for example in GNU Emacs
	  to
	  track the status of breakpoints, stack and local variables. But
	  it can
	  be used by other front-ends as well. The command-line option is
	  --annotate (-A) and there are set/show commands.
	  
	  Add emacs files to the package now. More complete Emacs code.

2007-11-03 21:19  Rocky Bernstein

	* First attempt to update and redo the GNU Emacs-to-rdebug
	  interface

2007-10-31 02:19  Rocky Bernstein

	* Can't handle "help info" this way. Ignore for now.

2007-10-31 02:00  Rocky Bernstein

	* Add basic test of the info command. (Much more would be nice.)

2007-10-12 10:15  Rocky Bernstein

	* .: interface.rb: print is really printf
	  runner.sh: was using variable before setting it
	  test/*breakpoints*: first integration test of breakpoints.

2007-10-12 01:45  Rocky Bernstein

	* Bug in setting a breakpoint at a main method (e.g. main.gcd).
	  Inside
	  breakpoint_by method we seem to get nil for the class name. The
	  fix
	  here is to change that to the string "main". Better might be to
	  have
	  that class name not be nil.
	  
	  test/breakpoints.cmd has a sequence of commands that when run on
	  gcd.rb will show the problem.

2007-10-11 08:59  Rocky Bernstein

	* Name conflick in test class name.

2007-10-11 01:07  Rocky Bernstein

	* helper.rb: move out some common test routines
	  *frame*: add test of frame commands: up, down, frame

2007-10-03 01:46  Rocky Bernstein

	* interface.rb: remove trailing \n.
	  test-stepping.rb: remove some bugs in cheap-diff
	  test/stepping.*: don't need "next 1" or "step 1", check without
	  parameter.

2007-09-30 13:09  Rocky Bernstein

	* Simplify even more.

2007-09-30 13:07  Rocky Bernstein

	* We're not using Diff::LCS so comment it out.

2007-09-30 02:50  Rocky Bernstein

	* Avoid duplicate constants which happens when "rake test" is run.

2007-09-30 02:48  Rocky Bernstein

	* .: cli/ruby-debug/interface.rb: add a verbose mode to show what
	  commands are
	  getting run.
	  
	  runner.sh: add the ability to set the rdebug script to run based
	  on environment
	  variable RDEBUG
	  
	  Both of the above are in support of adding the first integration
	  test
	  by running rdebug and comparing output produced. The first test
	  is of
	  commands in stepping.rb (step, next, finish). It is still a
	  little
	  hoaky and needs more work, but another step in the right
	  direction.

2007-09-07 04:30  Rocky Bernstein

	* control.rb: chdir back to directory where initial run came from.
	  command.rb, settings.rb, show.rb info.rb: remove warnings when
	  running
	  regression tests (due to initializing constants more than once)
	  
	  test/*: Use File.join where appropriate

2007-09-03 15:06  Rocky Bernstein

	* help "foo" gives message "Undefined command "foo" rather than a
	  list
	  of help commands. (Message test is gdb's)
	  
	  Add set linetrace+ - similar step+ for linetrace. Don't show
	  duplicate
	  lines.

2007-08-28 10:28  Rocky Bernstein

	* Get "ruby" from Gem.ruby if that exists.

2007-08-28 10:07  Rocky Bernstein

	* cmdparse -> setshow

2007-08-28 10:05  Rocky Bernstein

	* Rakefile: Make test/check depend on lib. Make more ruby like and
	  remove
	  duplicate "clean" target.

2007-08-28 03:07  Rocky Bernstein

	* Testing svn propset.

2007-08-28 03:06  Rocky Bernstein

	* Add $Id$ line propset.

2007-08-28 02:37  Rocky Bernstein

	* Yay! Start first real regression test. Here we are just trying
	  out
	  some set/show commands.

2007-08-22 08:28  Rocky Bernstein

	* leaving irb shows position same as entering debugger; "list"
	  position
	  is also cleared when leaving irb.
	  
	  Update documentation for the above but more generally to talk
	  about
	  the default position that is used in "list", And more
	  specifically the
	  frame command also resets the default position.

2007-08-08 07:58  Rocky Bernstein

	* Remove duplicate "include"

2007-08-07 17:58  Rocky Bernstein

	* Better parsing of undisplay. This time for sure.

2007-08-07 17:44  Rocky Bernstein

	* Better parameters parsing for the "undisplay" command.

2007-08-05 16:52  Rocky Bernstein

	* Work on bugs in restart command.
	  Work on ruby-debug sample sessions. Much more work is still
	  needed though.

2007-08-04 13:36  Rocky Bernstein

	* settings, processor, show: display expressions should be shown
	  when line tracing. To this end change always_run from
	  a boolean on integer "level" number.
	  
	  eval.rb pc -> putl
	  
	  ruby_debug.c: replace a non-word in a comment its equivalent
	  ruby-debug.texi: document recent changes pc->putl, display
	  expresions appear when line tracing

2007-07-21 14:50  Rocky Bernstein

	* *** empty log message ***

2007-07-21 13:54  Rocky Bernstein

	* .: Changes to make ruby-debug work for 1.9 (at least minimally).
	  ruby_debug.c: parameter saving seems to have a bug in it. Don't
	  turn on by default.
	  runner.sh: set which ruby using environment variable RUBY.

2007-07-19 03:08  Rocky Bernstein

	* Add "set" option to save scalar values and class names on each
	  call.
	  Add pc (print columnized) and ps (print sorted columnized).

2007-07-09 16:37  Rocky Bernstein

	* Guard against unitialized argv setting - via Debugger.start?

2007-07-02 15:34  Rocky Bernstein

	* "," -> ", ". This looks nicer.

2007-06-27 12:46  Rocky Bernstein

	* Note recent change to run HOME *after* a local init file.

2007-06-26 07:05  Rocky Bernstein

	* Run .rdebugrc on Debugger.start. Look for this in the current
	  directory and run that instead the one in $HOME if that exists.
	  Again, inspired and compatible with gdb.
	  
	  rdebug: Check script for syntax errors before loading. We get
	  more informative errors and it doesn't look like rdebug is at
	  fault.

2007-06-21 11:30  Rocky Bernstein

	* Node script->source.

2007-06-21 11:25  Rocky Bernstein

	* Some small changes missing from last update. script->source and
	  change help
	  wording slightly.

2007-06-21 10:39  Rocky Bernstein

	* test-ruby-debug.rb, Rakefile: revise so "rake test" works with
	  recent reorganization.
	  ruby-debug.c: remove unused variable declaration (and compile
	  warning)
	  command.rb: remove a warning given when "$DEBUG" or warnings are
	  set
	  script.rb: rename "script" to "source" to be more in line with
	  gdb
	  ruby-debug.texi: document "source" command, .rdebugrc and how
	  command files
	  work.

2007-06-05 18:54  Kent Sibilev

	* moved utility modules to helper.rb

2007-06-05 16:36  Kent Sibilev

	* code reorganization.
	  reverted 'run' command.

2007-06-05 04:28  Rocky Bernstein

	* Put back print statements the way they were. It seems important
	  to use
	  commas in print statments and not %.

2007-06-05 03:48  Kent Sibilev

	* tabs to spaces
	  changed copy.args to play nicely with GC

2007-06-04 14:52  Rocky Bernstein

	* Fix bug: When line contains format strings like %s, print thinks
	  there were too few arguments.
	  Fix by expanding % to %% and creating a print1 routine which
	  takes one parameter.
	  Not sure if this is the best fix.
	  
	  Traceback:
	  INTERNAL ERROR!!! too few arguments
	  /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/ruby-debug-0.9.4/cli/ruby-debug/interface.rb:12:in

2007-06-04 11:52  Rocky Bernstein

	* ruby-debug.texi: Start listing "set" commands.
	  settings.rb: change basename help

2007-06-04 00:06  Rocky Bernstein

	* Small bug in setting ARGV on restart.

2007-06-03 23:50  Rocky Bernstein

	* Catch all uncaught exceptions in rdebug's top-level run loop.

2007-06-03 11:50  Rocky Bernstein

	* Allow run when there is more than one thread.
	  Disallow run unless called from rdebug.
	  Reset ARGV on run.

2007-06-03 02:44  Rocky Bernstein

	* Get warm restart working for one thread - it might even work on
	  OSX ;-)

2007-06-02 22:43  Rocky Bernstein

	* Typo.

2007-06-02 16:14  Rocky Bernstein

	* Add routine to canonicalize file name. This also helps out Emacs.
	  Independent it's useful to have a place to funnel how to show
	  filenames. Add set basename to allow short filename setting which
	  will be useful in regression tests.

2007-06-02 15:01  Rocky Bernstein

	* lib/ruby-debug-base.rb: add Quit and Restart exceptions which can
	  reliably be used after the delayed exception handling bug is
	  fixed
	  emacs/rdebug-track.el and cli/ruby-debug/processor.rb: more
	  accurate line tracking in EMACS. When not in emacs should be more
	  like what was there.

2007-05-31 02:21  Rocky Bernstein

	* Typo.

2007-05-31 02:15  Rocky Bernstein

	* Add Emacs locations on breakpoints and catchpoints

2007-05-30 16:21  Rocky Bernstein

	* Debug statement creapt in.

2007-05-30 16:15  Rocky Bernstein

	* .: runner.sh - allow running outside of trunk directory
	  command.rb: do better about putting "at line" on another line
	  when we overflow the line width.

2007-05-30 06:05  Rocky Bernstein

	* Columnize *has* been added.

2007-05-30 05:50  Rocky Bernstein

	* Oops another bug if no "set" parameter has been given.
	  "set autoirb on" seems to mess up syntax checking.

2007-05-30 05:21  Rocky Bernstein

	* arg -> args

2007-05-27 18:37  Rocky Bernstein

	* Catch uncaught exceptions in main loop.

2007-05-27 15:56  Rocky Bernstein

	* .: Pass back $? from ruby-debug.

2007-05-27 15:53  Rocky Bernstein

	* Make sure Ruby script syntax checks okay. Otherwise we get a load
	  message that looks like rdebug has a problem.

2007-05-27 14:36  Rocky Bernstein

	* .: Fix bug in ignoring "-r debug"

2007-05-26 22:18  Rocky Bernstein

	* Add show version.

2007-05-26 22:00  Rocky Bernstein

	* Add set args and set listsize.

2007-05-26 20:38  Rocky Bernstein

	* command.rb, show.rb: Add show args
	  control.rb: back off on using AR

2007-05-26 13:56  Rocky Bernstein

	* Set now allows "on", "off", 1 or 0.
	  Add set/show linetrace
	  Add show keep-frame-bindings, port, port-mortem.

2007-05-26 04:42  Rocky Bernstein

	* Introduced bug after reworking "info args". make "local args"
	  truncate
	  output if it's too long same as info args.

2007-05-26 04:17  Rocky Bernstein

	* Recent batch of changes.

2007-05-26 03:22  Rocky Bernstein

	* breakpoints.rb: break with no arguments sets a breakpoint at the
	  current line
	  same as gdb
	  rdebug: if there's a tty and no stop restart the program when it
	  finishes

2007-05-25 13:48  Rocky Bernstein

	* Go over errror messages.

2007-05-25 13:43  Rocky Bernstein

	* If prepending a ruby command on restart, add "-I" for each $:
	  Check to see of Debugger::PROG_SCRIPT exists and is executable.

2007-05-25 12:35  Rocky Bernstein

	* Fix some small bugs. restart still has problems though.

2007-05-25 12:21  Rocky Bernstein

	* Fix small bug in restart parameter passing i introduced.

2007-05-25 10:11  Rocky Bernstein

	* Allow restart to work more often.

2007-05-25 09:34  Rocky Bernstein

	* Reduce the redundancy a little between set and show.

2007-05-25 08:50  Rocky Bernstein

	* Add info and show commands with subcommands.
	  Setting subcommands made to be more like info and show (and gdb).

2007-05-25 07:48  Rocky Bernstein

	* Have to back off from showing parameter values since we are
	  showing the
	  dynamic value. So instead we show the paramater class.
	  
	  It should be possible to show the value however if
	  --keep-frame-bindings is
	  true.

2007-05-24 18:11  Rocky Bernstein

	* This Ruby, not Perl: "last" => "break"

2007-05-24 13:03  Rocky Bernstein

	* Add sandbox for rocky to work in

2007-05-23 02:20  Rocky Bernstein

	* Fix type conversion problem with comparing Fixnum with String. I
	  really need to start pushing forward on the regression tests.

2007-05-22 12:28  Rocky Bernstein

	* Some rudimentary tests.

2007-05-21 13:42  Rocky Bernstein

	* Using long option --verbose without a script says you need a
	  script.
	  -v doesn't (same as --version).

2007-05-20 17:17  Rocky Bernstein

	* Stray debug output got inserted accidentally.

2007-05-20 17:01  Rocky Bernstein

	* Wasn't returning on a bad continue argument.

2007-05-20 16:45  Rocky Bernstein

	* breakpoints.rb: delete now will take a list
	  of breakpoint numbers. We now check file and line numbers to make
	  sure they
	  exist before adding a breakpoint. Overall make more gdb
	  compatible and use
	  gdb-like wording in giving status and error output.
	  
	  ruby-debug.texi: document break, catch and delete. Extend sample
	  session a little.

2007-05-18 09:20  Rocky Bernstein

	* What's up.

2007-05-18 09:13  Rocky Bernstein

	* More minor tweaks to thread regexps. Allows "thread" and "thread
	  nnn" work

2007-05-18 08:52  Rocky Bernstein

	* threads.rb: hoist common thread number parse routines

2007-05-18 02:34  Rocky Bernstein

	* Go over regexps to make errors make more sense. Use getint.
	  Common
	  code needs refactoring.

2007-05-17 14:03  Rocky Bernstein

	* -d option: turns on $DEBUG
	  -v option: print version number, then turn on verbose mode
	  ($VERBOSE)
	  --verbose turns on verbose mode ($VERBOSE)
	  --version works the same
	  --verbose turns on verbose mode ($VERBOSE)

2007-05-16 00:27  Kent Sibilev

	* wrong module to include

2007-05-15 20:22  Kent Sibilev

	* various fixes

2007-05-09 16:56  Kent Sibilev

	* '-r' option can be used to require additional libraries

2007-05-02 17:36  Kent Sibilev

	* expand path before running the script

2007-04-28 00:32  Kent Sibilev

	* 

2007-04-27 23:30  Kent Sibilev

	* added option to not start control thread by default

2007-04-27 23:20  Kent Sibilev

	* ditto

2007-04-27 21:03  Kent Sibilev

	* better name

2007-04-27 20:59  Kent Sibilev

	* make sure we dont throw in a wrong context

2007-04-27 20:43  Kent Sibilev

	* fixed rdoc

2007-04-27 20:31  Kent Sibilev

	* - irb 'cont' command continues execution without showing the
	  debugger prompt.
	  - added Debugger.settings method to programatically modify
	  command settings

2007-04-27 06:14  Kent Sibilev

	* note the latest changes

2007-04-27 06:12  Kent Sibilev

	* Compatibility with Ruby-distributed debug module

2007-04-27 06:07  Kent Sibilev
