This is a full-blown debugger user interface to the Ruby rdebug
debugger shell.

The main features are:

 * Window layout with dedicated windows for:
     + Local and member variables
     + Stack trace
     + Display expressions
     + Breakpoints
     + Output
     + Debugger Shell

 * Source-level debugging:
     + The current source file is shown and current line is marked.
     + Function keys bindings for effective stepping in the source code.
     + A "Debugger" menu for easy access to all features.

 * A number of predefined window layouts and key bindings are
   supplied, including binding that emulate Eclipse and NetBeans.
   The user can easily provide their own window layout and
   settings.

The default window layout looks like the following:

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                Toolbar                               |
+-----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| Debugger Stack Buffer             | Local Variables buffer           |

|                           Source buffer                              |
|                                                                      |
